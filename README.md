# Log Analysis Script for Cybersecurity Insights
# Problem Statement
Modern IT infrastructure generates extensive log files that capture critical information about system events, user interactions, and potential security breaches. Analyzing these log files manually is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error.

To address this challenge, organizations need automated solutions that can efficiently extract, analyze, and present actionable insights from log files. This is especially critical in cybersecurity, where identifying malicious activities like brute-force attacks, unauthorized access attempts, or suspicious patterns is essential for system security.
